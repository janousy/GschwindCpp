/*
ยง Implement a function findIf(Iterator iter, Matcher matcher) in Java
    that finds the first element in the sequence defined by iter.
    Matcher is an interface with a single method match return true if
    the element matches.
ยง Implement in a separate Java file a benchmark that executes the
        above on a Vector with several millions of elements.
ยง Implement the same benchmark in C++ with the C++ find_if
        method and, e.g., lambdas.
ยง Try to optimize BOTH (Java and C++) solutions.  However, the
        matcher and the elements stored in the container shall be generic.
