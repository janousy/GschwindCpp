le4:
slide 284 copy and swap idom:
 - dont really understand what is refernced by *this in String &operator=?
 - you may not be able to use std::swap, why not do you mean if custom data types

le7:
does delctype need to resolved at compile time? if yes the we can not use it with inheritance?
can we always use remove_reference, even if no refernce is returned`?

Literals couldnt follow your explanation on this slide. 

templates vs inheritance?
Are there any good guidlines when to use which?
could you give an example where we need run time polymorphism?
